# Introduction

[![Screenshot](public/demo/frontpage.jpg)](public/demo/frontpage.jpg)

**FatDriveSorter** helps you *actually* sort files on your FAT drives

## Why does this exist?

FAT drives store files using a **raw** sort order. It's not alphabetical, most recent, etc. It's a purely technical sort order which the user can't enforce easily.

Some simple devices, such as MP3 players or hand-held consoles, display files without sorting. This leads to a surprising sort order for the user. FatDriveSorter uses technical tricks to enforce a better sort order.

## Features

* Enforce raw file order on your FAT drives
* See the current raw file order on your FAT drives

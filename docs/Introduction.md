# Introduction

[![Screenshot](public/demo/frontpage.jpg)](public/demo/frontpage.jpg)

**FatDriveSorter** helps you *actually* sort files on your FAT drives

## Why does this exist?

FAT drives store files using a **raw** sort order. It's not alphabetical, most recent, etc. It's a purely technical sort order which the user can't enforce easily.

Some simple devices, such as MP3 players or hand-held consoles, display files without sorting. This leads to a surprising sort order for the user. FatDriveSorter uses technical tricks to enforce a better sort order.

## Features

* Enforce raw file order on your FAT drives (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT)
* See the current raw file order
* Customize the sort order
* Only sort a specific directory

## Privacy and respecting the user

* FatDriveSorter doesnâ€™t send or receive any data without explicit user consent. It may ask the user to send a crash report after a crash for example, but it will never spy on the user.
* FatDriveSorter tries to use as few resources as it can: CPU, memory, disk, etc. All images are compressed, FatDriveSorter is optimized to be as light as possible on the user resources.

## Using the embedded fatsort CLI

FatDriveSorter includes a built of [fatsort](https://fatsort.sourceforge.io/). It is located in the .app bundle, at `FatDriveSorter.app/Contents/MacOS/fatsort`. It can be called from the Terminal to do advanced sorting. You can call `fatsort -h` for to see the options.
